Python scripts used for lighting and imaging experiments as part of my thesis titled "Towards Improving Imaging in Scattering Environments"

Quick Abstract: Underwater lighting attenuates quickly - proportional to the volume of water the light passes through. The quality of ocean floor images can be significantly improved if instead of using a floodlight, a small section of lighting is scanned across the target. The resulting images generated from each area lit can be stitched together to form a complete image of the target. This thesis shows that stripe lighting solves this need by limiting the scatter interaction volume and is implementable for several meters of light transport. This technique outperforms existing illumination and imaging methodologies by reducing both forward scatter (increased sharpness) and backscatter (increased contrast) for imaging targets.
